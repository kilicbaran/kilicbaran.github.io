00:00.100 --> 00:02.600
This is my first program written in Visual Basic.

00:03.200 --> 00:04.900
It is a ranked flashcard app.

00:05.800 --> 00:08.800
When you press the button it shows a word and you need to guess its meaning.

00:09.300 --> 00:14.500
When you press again, you get the definitions, translation of the word and some example sentences.

00:14.900 --> 00:18.300
In this app, I have the definitions of the words in Turkish and German.

00:18.700 --> 00:21.800
There are 3 buttons labeled "Easy", "Medium", and "Hard".

00:22.200 --> 00:23.700
Let's select "Hard" for this word.

00:24.100 --> 00:26.100
This will make this word appear more often.

00:27.100 --> 00:28.100
Let's get a new word.

00:28.600 --> 00:31.300
You can press the this button to play the pronunciation of the word.

00:31.800 --> 00:35.800
The pronunciation is also available in International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA).

00:37.100 --> 00:41.300
The second tab contains some example words to pronounce a specific IPA character.

00:42.500 --> 00:44.700
On the third tab, you can see the some options.

00:45.100 --> 00:47.300
Instead of predicting the meaning from the word, 

00:47.400 --> 00:50.200
you can see the meaning and predict the word that has such a meaning. 

01:02.000 --> 01:04.500
So this was my first program. Thanks for watching.
